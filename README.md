Hello World GitHub Actions Workflow

Description
The Hello World GitHub Actions Workflow is a simple demonstration of how to automate tasks in your repository using GitHub Actions. This workflow triggers on every push event to the repository, executing a single job that outputs the message "Hello World!" to the console. It's a great starting point for understanding how GitHub Actions can be used to enhance your development workflow.

Workflow Configuration
This workflow is defined in a YAML file (.github/workflows/hello-world.yml) and consists of the following key components:

Trigger: The workflow is set to trigger on the push event, meaning it will execute whenever a commit is pushed to the repository.
Job: The workflow contains a single job named my-job, which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu (ubuntu-latest).
Step: The job includes one step named my-step, which executes a simple shell command to print "Hello World!" to the console.
